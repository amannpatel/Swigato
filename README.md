# Restaurant Management System

Welcome to the Restaurant Management System, a fully functional web application built using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. This comprehensive system encompasses seamless frontend-backend integration, Firebase authentication, JWT token access, an admin panel for management, payment processing, image hosting, and an online food ordering system with order management features.

## ðŸ”§ Main Functionalities

### 1. Frontend and Backend Integration

Achieve a smooth and responsive user experience with seamless integration between the frontend and backend. Utilizing the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js), this system ensures a cohesive and efficient interaction between the user interface and server.

### 2. Secure Authentication System

Implement a robust authentication system using Firebase authentication, ensuring secure and reliable user registration and login processes. User credentials are encrypted and stored securely, providing a trustworthy foundation for the system.

### 3. JWT Token Access

Enhance security with JSON Web Token (JWT) access. Users receive a token upon successful authentication, providing a secure means of communication between the frontend and backend, while protecting sensitive data and actions.

### 4. Admin Panel for Management

Empower administrators with a dedicated panel for efficient management. The admin panel allows easy monitoring of user activity, menu updates, and order management. Admins can review and modify restaurant details and keep the system up-to-date.

### 5. Payment Processing

Facilitate seamless transactions through integrated payment processing. Utilizing industry-standard payment gateways, users can securely pay for their orders directly through the application, enhancing convenience and user satisfaction.

### 6. Image Hosting

Effortlessly manage and display images with integrated image hosting. This feature enables the system to store and serve images, enhancing the visual appeal of the menu and overall user experience.

### 7. Online Food Ordering System

Create an intuitive and user-friendly online food ordering system. Users can browse the menu, add items to their cart, and place orders with ease. Real-time updates keep users informed about the status of their orders.

### 8. Order Management

Streamline order management for both users and administrators. Users can track the status of their orders, while administrators can efficiently manage and fulfill incoming orders through the admin panel.
